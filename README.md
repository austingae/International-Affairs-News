Named after my International Affairs department, Elliott provides you with the most recent international news of various regions of the world and special topics. In this project, I used HTML, CSS, SASS, JSON, and Javascript along with the NEWS API on the React-based Next.js.

In this project, I learned many new things:
- This was my first time working with an API. In order to understand the News API and retrieve its JSON data, I carefully read their documentation. 
- In order to understand how the News API works, I had to learn JSON, specifically how to write my own .json files and how to retrieve .json data in my project. 
- I also learned SASS to make the styling of the website easier. I haven't used SASS's mixins or functions in this project, but I used variables, partials, and especially nesting to better structure my CSS. 
- I was able to learn more about the React-based Next.js. I really like how Next.js takes care of the routing for me -- really simplifies things for me without having to use React Router in Vanilla ReactJS. I also learned how their data fetching functions work. 
- I also learned how to work with Splide, a package that allows me to easily make sliders.
